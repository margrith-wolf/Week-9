Inspirations for this project were Pandora and Spotify. I attempted to create a web-based music platform that allowed users to search for desired artists and
show them what they've been listening to. The contact page was a second page requirement of the assignment. I created an interactive serach bar that would allow users
to search for upcoming tour dates of their favorite artists and the results would show in an interactive table. Additionally, the contact page has a form that would allow the website to push weekly newsletters about
various topics to their clients.
